# Discussion: Article V - On History and Repair

## The Article

"We speak plainly: the modern world stands atop injuries, colonial theft, slavery, genocide, and systematic exclusion. Recognition is not enough. We commit to repair: to address inherited inequalities, to honor Indigenous stewardship and relationships with land, to return what was taken and restore self-determination, to shape economies that serve people and planet rather than extraction and discard."
