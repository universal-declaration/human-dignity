# A Universal Declaration of Human Dignity and Mutual Flourishing

This is a living document, an attempt to articulate principles for human dignity that acknowledge both universal aspirations and particular contexts, both individual rights and collective responsibilities, both historical injuries and future obligations.

## This is not
- A final statement
- A Western imposition
- A utopian fantasy
- A replacement for local wisdom

## This is
- An invitation to dialogue
- A working draft
- A bridge between traditions
- A commitment to keep trying

## Core Principle
"These principles are universal in spirit and particular in practice."

## Why This Matters Now

We stand at a convergence of crises:
- Ecological systems approaching irreversible tipping points
- Inequality deepening within and between nations
- Technologies reshaping what it means to be human
- Historical injuries demanding recognition and repair
- Global challenges requiring unprecedented cooperation

Previous declarations, however noble, have proven insufficient. We need principles that:
- Bridge individual and collective rights
- Honor Indigenous wisdom alongside other traditions
- Take seriously our obligations to future generations
- Recognize the Earth as partner, not property
- Address historical injuries, not just future aspirations

## Who This Is For

Everyone. Specifically:
- Communities seeking alternatives to extractive systems
- Movements working for justice and regeneration
- Individuals questioning inherited assumptions
- Organizations trying to embody better values
- Future generations who will inherit what we build

## How to Engage

### For Individuals
- Read and sit with the principles
- Share with your community
- Propose refinements based on your experience

### For Communities
- Translate into your language and context
- Create local adaptations
- Document how you implement these principles

### For Organizations

- Share practical applications
- Contribute learnings from implementation

### For Scholars
- Add historical context and philosophical grounding
- Document connections across traditions
- Critique constructively with alternative formulations

## Living Document Philosophy

This declaration is designed to evolve. Not through endless revision that dilutes meaning, but through thoughtful iteration that deepens understanding. Each contribution should:
- Strengthen rather than weaken core commitments
- Include rather than exclude voices
- Clarify rather than obscure meaning
- Connect rather than divide communities
