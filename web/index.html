                <div class="article-text">All human beings are born with inherent dignity. This dignity is not granted by the state, the market, or the crowd; it is native to the person and alive in relation, to family, to community, to the Earth that sustains us.</div>

In one, it claims rights: to live with worth, to speak and to choose, to be secure in body and livelihood, to participate in the decisions that shape one's days, to practice culture and spirit without fear, to seek wellbeing in harmony with others and with nature, to be heard when wronged and made whole. In the other, it accepts responsibilities: to oneself in honesty, to one's community in good faith, to future generations in stewardship, and to the living Earth in restraint and care.</div>

Autonomy without solidarity corrodes into indifference; solidarity without autonomy hardens into control. We choose both: the liberty to forge a path, and the bonds that make us safe enough to try.</div>

When a system becomes hostile to these ends, when oppression, exploitation, or ecological ruin become its habit, it is the right and duty of the people to reform it or replace it.</div>
