# Local and Regional Adaptations

This directory contains interpretations and implementations of the declaration principles in specific contexts.

## Purpose

While the declaration articulates universal principles, their application must be particular. This space is for communities to share:
- How they interpret the principles
- What modifications serve their context
- How they're implementing these ideas
- What challenges they face
- What successes they've achieved

## Contributing an Adaptation

### Format Suggestions

1. **Context Introduction**
   - Geographic location
   - Community description
   - Historical background
   - Current challenges

2. **Principle Interpretations**
   - How each article translates to your context
   - Which principles resonate most strongly
   - Which need modification and why
   - What's missing for your community

3. **Implementation**
   - Concrete steps taken
   - Institutions created or modified
   - Practices developed
   - Measurements of success

4. **Learnings**
   - What's working
   - What's not working
   - Unexpected discoveries
   - Advice for others

### File Naming

- Use descriptive names: `indigenous-amazon-brazil.md`
- Include region/community: `urban-commons-barcelona.md`
- Add year if relevant: `rural-kenya-2025.md`

## Types of Adaptations Welcome

- **Geographic**: City, region, nation adaptations
- **Cultural**: Religious, ethnic, linguistic community interpretations
- **Organizational**: How institutions implement these principles
- **Movement**: How social movements use the declaration
- **Experimental**: New communities testing these ideas

## Principles for Adaptation

1. **Honor the Spirit**: While modifying specifics, maintain commitment to dignity, repair, and mutual flourishing
2. **Add, Don't Subtract**: Build on principles rather than removing them
3. **Document Process**: Share how you arrived at your adaptation
4. **Include Many Voices**: Ensure adaptation reflects community, not just leaders
5. **Stay Connected**: Link with other adaptations for mutual learning

## Learning Across Adaptations

As adaptations accumulate, we can identify:
- Common patterns across different contexts
- Unique innovations from specific places
- Tensions that need addressing
- Principles that need clarification
- New articles that might be needed

## Not Looking For

- Adaptations that exclude or demean any group
- Versions that ignore historical harm
- Interpretations that abandon ecological responsibility
- Modifications that center only individual or only collective
- Changes that claim universality for particular views

## Questions for Adaptation

- What would these principles mean in practice here?
- What local wisdom should be incorporated?
- What historical injuries need addressing?
- What future do we want to create?
- How do we measure progress?
- Who needs to be involved?

## Connection and Exchange

Adaptations aren't isolated experiments but part of a global dialogue. Consider:
- Linking with similar communities elsewhere
- Sharing challenges and solutions
- Learning from different approaches
- Building solidarity across adaptations

*Every adaptation enriches our understanding of how dignity and flourishing can be achieved in different contexts. Your community's interpretation matters.*
