# Contributing to the Universal Declaration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this living document. This declaration is meant to evolve through thoughtful dialogue and diverse perspectives.

## Core Principles for Contribution

1. **Respect the Spirit**: While specific language may evolve, contributions should honor the core commitment to human dignity, mutual flourishing, and ecological responsibility.

2. **Include Multiple Voices**: We especially welcome perspectives from:
   - Indigenous communities
   - Historically marginalized groups
   - Non-Western philosophical traditions
   - Youth and future-focused movements
   - Local and regional contexts

3. **Practice What We Preach**: Engage with the same principles of dignity and respect that the declaration advocates.

## How to Contribute

- Create translations that capture both literal meaning and cultural resonance
- Place translations in the `/translations/` directory
- Use standard language codes (e.g., `es-ES.md`, `zh-CN.md`)
- Include translator notes where cultural context is important

### 2. Article Discussions
- Open discussions about specific articles in `/discussions/`
- Format: `article-XX-topic.md`
- Include:
  - Your interpretation or concern
  - Cultural or regional context
  - Suggested refinements
  - Questions for dialogue

### 3. Local Adaptations
- Share how your community interprets or implements these principles

- Explain what modifications serve your local needs

### 4. Historical Context

## Process for Major Changes

1. **Start with Discussion**: Open an issue or discussion file before proposing changes to core articles
2. **Gather Perspectives**: Allow time for multiple viewpoints
3. **Document Reasoning**: Explain why changes better serve the declaration's purpose
4. **Seek Consensus**: Major changes should have broad support, not just majority vote

## What We Won't Accept

- Changes that diminish universal human dignity
- Proposals that ignore historical injuries or ongoing oppression
- Modifications that weaken ecological commitments
- Language that excludes or demeans any group
- Purely theoretical debates without practical consideration

## Language and Style

- Clear, accessible language over academic jargon
- Inclusive rather than exclusive framing
- Concrete rather than abstract where possible
- Respectful acknowledgment of different worldviews

## Questions or Concerns?

If you're unsure about a contribution, start with a discussion. This declaration grows through dialogue, not decree.

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged unless they prefer to remain anonymous. This is a collective effort, and every thoughtful contribution matters.
