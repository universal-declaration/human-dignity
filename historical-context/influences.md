## Synthesis Attempts in This Declaration

Rather than hierarchy or synthesis, this declaration attempts:

1. **Dialogue**: Let different traditions speak without forcing agreement
2. **Complementarity**: Recognize different truths for different contexts
3. **Minimum Overlap**: Find shared ground without erasing difference
4. **Creative Tension**: Use disagreement productively
5. **Epistemic Humility**: Acknowledge limits of any single tradition

## Key Tensions Acknowledged

- **Individual vs Collective**: Both/and rather than either/or
- **Universal vs Particular**: Universal spirit, particular practice
- **Rights vs Responsibilities**: Inseparable aspects of dignity
- **Human vs Nature**: Expanded community including Earth
- **Present vs Future**: Obligations across time
- **Ideal vs Real**: Aspiration grounded in current struggle

## What's Different

This declaration differs from predecessors by:
- Not claiming singular philosophical foundation
- Explicitly addressing historical harm
- Including Earth as stakeholder
- Balancing rights with responsibilities
- Acknowledging need for local translation
- Seeing itself as provisional, not final

## Ongoing Questions

- Can true universalism emerge from dialogue rather than domination?
- How do we honor difference without relativism?
- What obligations do we have to traditions we've harmed?
- How do we include voices of future and more-than-human?
- Can law capture wisdom, or does it always reduce it?
